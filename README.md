Data is a sequence of characters or symbols that are stored and processed for analysis purposes. The computer data is also a stream of bits (0s and 1s) that are stored in the computer memory for further processing or translation.

These bits can be information in the form of text docs, images, videos, or some other type of data. This data is in a form that is perfect for movement and processing.

This data processing is done by the CPU(Central Processing Unit) and stored in the computer’s memory. Therefore, the data in the computer can be created, processed, and stored.


## Types of Data
The data in computers can be categorized into three types- 

Data at rest 
Data in transit
And, the data in use


## How is Data Stored?
The data on a computer can be stored in multiple ways. One way is to store in the hard disk – this is for data at rest. Another way is to store in the RAM or CPU registers – for data in transit or data in use.

Other than these old methods, data is now stored on cloud storage where it is assembled in a very organized way. This data can be accessed anytime and the most fascinating thing is you can never run out of storage.

But with so many ways to store data, comes the risk of these sensitive data getting attacked by unknown sources.
